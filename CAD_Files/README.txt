I created these SolidWorks 2020 files as part of an individual project to design a three-wheeled omnidirectional drive base. 

The main feature of the design is a Swedish 90 wheel, which consists of 14 rollers and 4 side panels. 

I also designed 3D-printable wheel mounts and used aluminum din rail to create a sturdy chassis. 

Feel free to use these files if you're interested in exploring robotics or looking to build a similar project.
