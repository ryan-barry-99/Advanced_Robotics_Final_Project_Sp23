- Wheel_Mount.SLDPRT: 3D printable 120 deg bracket for wheel shafts. Press fit bearing holes
- clip.SLDPRT: Screw in clips to hold foam board on chassis
- spacer_025.SLDPRT: Allows wheel to freely rotate without interference from bolt head
- washer.SLDPRT: To be placed between wheel halfs and give rollers room for free rotation

## File Formats
The CAD files were created using SOLIDWORKS 2021 and are compatible with the 2021 version or later. If you need the files in a different format, you can use the software's export function to convert them.

## Usage
To open the CAD files, open SOLIDWORKS and select File > Open. Navigate to the location of the CAD files and select the one you want to open. You can then view and edit the part as needed.
