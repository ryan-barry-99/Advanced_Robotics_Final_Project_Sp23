# Balloon Trajectory Matching Omnidirectional Robot using YOLO

This project aims to track a balloon using a custom YOLO model and punch it back into the air using a 3 wheeled omnidirectional drive robot. The robot moves in any direction without having to turn, which makes it perfect for this task. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 were both trained on the V2 Balloon dataset, with YOLOv8 tending to be more efficient and percise
