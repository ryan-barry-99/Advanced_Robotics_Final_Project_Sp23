# Balloon Trajectory Matching Omnidirectional Robot using YOLO

This project aims to track a balloon using a custom YOLO model and punch it back into the air using a 3 wheeled omnidirectional drive robot. The robot moves in any direction without having to turn, which makes it perfect for this task.
